/**
 * At Airbnb, you could imagine total reservation costs are computed from a base price and some fees and taxes.
 * The base price may be an integer, but taxes and fees are percentage based, so the total amount could add up to be
 * non-whole number. Fox example, base price = 100, fee = 2.3 and taxes = 1.4, would lead to a net reservation cost
 * of 103.7. However, we want net reservation cost, to be shown on our website, to be an integer.
 *
 * Given base price, fee and taxes, we would like to round them such that they add up to a desired total while minimizing
 * the rounding error. More formally, we're going to solve the general case:
 *
 * Given numbers =prices=[x1, x2,...,Xn]= and target price =target=. We want to find a way to round each element in prices
 * such that after rounding, we get rounded numbers =roundedPrices=[y1, y2, ..., yn] such that y1+y2+...+yn = target where
 * yi = floor(xi) or Ceil(xi), floor or ceiling of xi. We also want to minimize the rounding error given by the sum = E|xi-yi|
 * for 1 <= i and i <= n. Return the rounded numbers roundedPrices.
 *
 * The test cases will guarantee that there is a valid unique output of roundedPrices
 *
 * Time Complexity restrictions
 * You should implement an algorithm that doest not use brute force to solve the problem
 *
 * Sample input
 * prices = [0.70, 2.80, 4.90]
 * targe = 8
 *
 * Sample output
 * [0,3,5]
 *
 * Explanation
 * roudedPrices = [0,3,5] with a total rounding error of 0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1. Thats better than [1,2,5], which has a total
 * rounding error of 0.3 + 0.8 +Â´0.1 = 1.2
